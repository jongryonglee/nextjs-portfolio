      description: `
        I'm a front-end developer with a strong focus on implementing clean, responsive, and visually engaging user interfaces.
        I specialize in faithfully translating design requirements into interactive web experiences that not only look great but also feel intuitive to use.
        With experience across multiple web projects, I've contributed to everything from crafting UI components to designing layouts from scratch.
        My skill set covers a wide range of front-end technologies, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt. I've also started working on AI-related projects, including model training and integration into web applications â€” expanding my capabilities beyond just the visual layer.
